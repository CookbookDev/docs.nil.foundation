# Compiling a circuit

This tutorial contains step-by-step instructions on how to compile the [**arithmetic circuit created previously**](./writing-a-simple-circuit).

There are two possible ways for transforming a circuit into a proof binary and Solidity code.

- By calling individual tools
- By using [**the zkllvm-template project**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkllvm-template)

## Calling individual tools

### Run the compiler

To generate the circuit IR, complete one of the following tutorials.

<DocCardList/>

### Pass the IR to `assigner`

At this stage, the newly generated IR and the public info file are ready to be passed to `assigner`.

Run the following command to generate the circuit constraints and the assignment table.

```bash
assigner -b path/to/circuit.ll -i path/to/public_input.inp -c circuit.crct -t assignment.tbl -e pallas --generate-type circuit-assignment
```

### Use `transpiler` to generate the circuit proof

The `.crct` and `.tbl` files can be passed to the `transpiler` tool to generate a binary with the proof and Solidity files containing the circuit.

Run the below command to generate `proof.bin`.

```bash
transpiler -m gen-test-proof -c path/to/circuit.crct -t path/to/assignment.tbl -o output -e pallas
```

Execute the following command to produce Solidity files.

```bash
transpiler -m gen-evm-verifier -c path/to/circuit.crct -t path/to/assignment.tbl -o output -e pallas --optimize-gates
```

Congratulations! At this stage, we recommend taking a look at other examples in the zkLLVM repository and compiling them.

## Using `zkllvm-template`

[**`zkllvm-template` is a project**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkllvm-template) designed to simplify working with complex circuits and zk-enabled apps.

The project provides an easy-to-use interface for compiling circuits in one command instead of completing each step individually or reconfiguring build targets in `CMakeLists.txt`.

:::tip[Managing dependencies]

`zkllvm-template` handles dependency management via a pre-configured `CMakeLists.txt` file. If a circuit fails to compile due to issues with dependencies, consider using the template project.

:::

:::warning

`zkllvm-template` only supports C++ projects.

[**Compiling Rust code**](./compiling-rust-code) is done via a typical flow involving `cargo`, which eliminates the need for configuring `CMakeLists.txt`.

:::

To work with `zkllvm-template`, clone its repository with all sub-modules.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkllvm-template.git
cd zkllvm-template
```

Additionally, [**install all required tools**](./installation) from pre-built binaries.

Within `zkllvm-template`, the `./main` folder contains the `main.cpp` file that acts as the entry point for the `clang` compiler.

To run the compiler, execute the following command.

```bash
scripts/run.sh
```

This is equivalent to completing each individual step described in the previous section.
