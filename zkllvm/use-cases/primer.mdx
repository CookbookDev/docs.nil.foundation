# Primer

This primer acts as an intro guide to writing complex circuits and compiling them. 

## Dependency management

Most circuits that cover common use cases (e.g., circuits verifying state transitions) require the use of external dependencies. 

In such cases, [**using `clang` or `rustc` directly**](../getting-started/compiling-a-circuit) is discouraged. Instead, it is preferable to use a dedicated build management system:

* CMake for C++
* Cargo for Rust

:::tip[`clang`]

When calling `clang` directly, dependency management can also be handled via the following methods:

* Via the CLI
* Via env variables
* Via updating the system path

Using CMake is still preferable as it offers several valuable features (such as external library detection) that simplify working with complex circuits.

:::

:::info

This primer uses `crypto3` (C++) and `arkworks` (Rust) to show how to use external libraries in a circuit. The primer can be reused for any other suitable library.

:::

### Using CMake

Switch to the working directory:

```bash
mkdir new_circuit && cd new_circuit
```

Create a directory for CMake modules:

```bash
mkdir cmake && cd cmake
```

Add the [**`CircuitCompile.cmake` module from the zkLLVM repository**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkLLVM/blob/master/cmake/CircuitCompile.cmake) to the `./new_circuit/cmake` directory:

```
new_circuit
-- cmake
    -- CircuitCompile.cmake
```

Create the circuit:

```bash
cd .. && mkdir src
```

```bash
cd src && touch main.cpp
```

Add circuit code that references an external library:

```cpp
#include <nil/crypto3/hash/algorithm/hash.hpp>
#include <nil/crypto3/hash/sha2.hpp>

...

[[circuit]] bool circuit_func() {...}
```

Create a configuration file for CMake:

```bash
cd .. && touch CMakeLists.txt
```

Inside `CMakeLists.txt`, set the project config and include the `CircuitCompile.cmake` module:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2)

project(hashes_circuit
    VERSION 1.0
    DESCRIPTION "Tutorial circuit with hashes"
    LANGUAGES CXX)

list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "path/to/cmake")

include(CircuitCompile)
```

Add the required library to the project configuration:

```cmake
set(crypto3_DIR "path/to/crypto3_headers")

find_package(crypto3 REQUIRED)
```

:::tip[Boost]

`crypto3` already depends on Boost. If an alternative library (that does not depend on Boost) is used, add Boost manually:

```cmake
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system filesystem)
```

:::

Set the circuit source and add a build target:

```
set(SOURCES src/main.cpp)

add_circuit(
    circuit SOURCES ${SOURCES}
    LINK_LIBRARIES
    crypto3::all
    ${Boost_LIBRARIES}
)

set(binary_name circuit.ll)
```

, where `circuit` is the desired target name.

Compile the circuit with:

```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
cd build
make -C ./build circuit -j$(nproc)
```

:::warning

The `CircuitCompile.cmake` module does not support using custom paths to `clang` built from sources (as well as custom paths to a linker). To use this module, it is necessary to [**install the `zkllvm` Deb package**](../getting-started/installation#install-zkllvm-binaries).

:::

:::tip

Instead of specifying `crypto3_DIR` in `CMakeLists.txt`, it is possible to specify it when calling `cmake`:

```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . -Dcrypto3_DIR=/path/to/crypto3/installation
```

This method is useful if a dependency is installed in a custom location rather than `/usr/local/` or any other location requiring root permissions.

:::

### Using Cargo

Create a new `cargo` project:

```bash
cargo new new_circuit --bin
cd new_circuit
```

:::tip

Optionally add the `--vcs none` option to prevent `cargo` from automatically creating a Git repository.

:::

Open the `Cargo.toml` file and add the following dependencies and feature flags:

```toml
ark-pallas = { git = "https://github.com/NilFoundation/arkworks-curves.git" }
unroll = { git = "https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkllvm-unroll.git" }

...

[features]
zkllvm = ["ark-ff/zkllvm"]
```

:::tip

Adding `unroll` [**is mandatory**](../best-practices-limitations/unrolling-loops) for circuits that use loops.

:::

:::tip

The `"zkllvm"` feature flag is necessary to ensure compatibility with the original Rust compiler.

When calling Cargo, use the `--features zkllvm` option to enable the feature for the specified package. If the feature is enabled, built-in zkLLVM types are used to represent curves, fields, and other elements. If this feature is disabled, type definitions from the `arkworks` project are used.

The flag should only be used if `assigner-unknown-unknown` is the specified build target when calling `cargo`. If it is not used, calling `assigner` on the resulting circuit IR may fail.

If `cargo` is called for any other build target, omit the `--features zkllvm` option when calling Cargo.

:::

Add circuit code that references an external library:

```rust
#![no_main]

use ark_pallas::Fq;
...

type BlockType = [Fq; 2];

#[circuit]
pub fn sha256_example() -> BlockType {...}
```

Compile the circuit with:

```bash
cargo +zkllvm build --target assigner-unknown-unknown --features zkllvm --release
```
