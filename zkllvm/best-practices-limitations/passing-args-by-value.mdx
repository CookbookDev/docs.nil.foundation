# Passing arguments by value

Circuit functions accept arguments from [**public and private input files**](../getting-started/preparing-input-files). These arguments cannot contain memory addresses as there is no guarantee that an address will be valid when a circuit is eventually run.

As a result, arguments passed to circuit functions should be passed by value rather than by reference. 

The following examples contain examples of passing by value and passing by reference.

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value='cpp' label='C++'>
    ```cpp
    bool passing_by_reference(int *x) {}

    bool passing_by_value(int x) {}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='rust' label='Rust'>
    ```rust
    fn passing_by_reference(x: &mut i32) -> bool {}

    fn passing_by_value(x: i32) -> bool {}
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
