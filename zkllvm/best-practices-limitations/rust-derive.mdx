# Structs and enums in Rust

Whenever a Rust circuit is compiled, `rustc` applies various optimizations to reduce its memory usage.

Among these memory optimizations is [**reordering fields in structs and enums to avoid unnecessary 'paddings' in circuit IRs**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/repr-rust.html). Consider the following example:

```rust
use ark_pallas::Fq;

type BlockType = [Fq; 2];

pub struct BlockDataType {
    prev_block_hash: BlockType,
    data: BlockType,
    validators_signature: i32,
    validators_key: u64,
}
```

The public input representation of the `BlockDataType` struct would look as follows:

```json
"struct": [
    {
        "array": [{"field": 1}, {"field": 1}]
    },
    {
        "array": [{"field": 3}, {"field": 1}]
    },
    {
        "int": 1
    },
    {
        "int": 1
    }
]
```

When compiling the `BlockDataType` struct, `rustc` may reorder its fields.

When `assigner` is called on a circuit with this struct, the circuit IR would conflict with the public input as the field order in the IR and the public input file would no longer match.

To avoid this problem, use the `#[repr(C)]` directive:

```rust

use ark_pallas::Fq;

type BlockType = [Fq; 2];

#[repr(C)]
pub struct BlockDataType {
    prev_block_hash: BlockType,
    data: BlockType,
    validators_signature: i32,
    validators_key: u64,
}
```

If this directive is included, Rust will treat structs and enums as C-like types, meaning that `rustc` will never reorder fields in them.
