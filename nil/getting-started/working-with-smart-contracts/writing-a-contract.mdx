# Writing a contract

This tutorial explains how to create smart contracts that take full advantage of the unique features of =nil;.

## Specification

The tutorial defines two contracts.

Contract 1 acts as a registration contract for candidates in an election. It has the following features:

* It will [**accept external messages and verify them**](../essentials/receiving-ext-messages)
* It will be able to [**make async calls**](../essentials/handling-async-execution) to another contract
* It will [**limit who can can make calls**](../../tools/sol-library/func-modifiers) to some of its functions

Contract 2 verifies election candidates. It acts as the recepient of calls made by Contract 1. It also implements a basic multi-signature mechanism.

## Creating the first contract

To accept external messages, Contract 1 will use a simple verification mechanism.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Nil.sol";

contract Registrator {
    using Nil for address;

    mapping(address => bool) private communityMembers;

    function verifyExternal(uint256 messageHash, bytes calldata authData) external view returns (bool) {
        if (communityMembers[msg.sender] != true) {
            return false;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }
}
```

Only commynity members can register as candidates. Anyone else would not be able to send an external message to the contract.

```solidity
contract Registrator {

    address[] private candidates;
    address private verifierAddress;

    function registerAsCandidate(address dst) public onlyExternal {
        dst.asyncCall(address(0), 50000, false, msg.value, abi.encodeWithSignature("validateCandidate", dst));
    }

    function addCandidate(address dst) public onlyInternal {
        candidates.push(dst); 
    }
}
```
