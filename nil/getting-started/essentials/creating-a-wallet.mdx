# Creating a wallet

This tutorial defines how wallets work in =nil; and outlines the different ways for creating a new wallet.

## Definition

In =nil; a wallet is any smart contract that is able to pay for interactions with real-life users.

The traditional definition of a wallet in Ethereum mostly refers to externally-owned accounts (EOAs) that are secured via private keys and natively hold information about user's balances.

Wallets in =nil; greatly extend this definition. A =nil; wallet can be an EOA in the traditional sense of the term but it can also be any smart contract with a payment mechanism. As a result, it is possible to create wallets with arbitrary constructor bytecodes. This allows for adding complex logic to wallets such as multi-sig operations.

## New wallet creation

### Via the =nil; CLI

The =nil; CLI offers a quick and convenient way to create a new wallet:

```bash
nil_cli new-wallet
```

This will produce the following response:

```bash
New wallet address: NEW_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

This wallet essentially acts as a typical EOA: it supports basic asset management and authentication operations. The wallet should also be initialized with an initial balance. Send the following request to check this:

```bash
curl -X POST NIL_ENDPOINT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getBalance",
    "params": [
        "{NEW_WALLET_ADDRESS}",
        "latest"
    ],
    "id": 1
}'
```

The `"result"` key in the response should not equal zero.

### Via the client library
