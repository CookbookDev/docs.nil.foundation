# Reading from =nil;

This tutorial details the different ways that allow for reading and writing information to =nil;. It covers these actions:

1. Reading information from a block
2. Calling an existing smart contract
3. Retrieving data about the resulting message
4. Reading the message receipt

At the moment, =nil; has a flat gas price of 10. When sending a message, make sure that its value is equal to at least `10 * gasLimit`.

## Via the =nil; CLI

The =nil; CLI provides several commands that produce data about key cluster entities including blocks, messages, and logs. 

To view the latest block recorded by shard with `shardId = 1`:

```bash
nil_cli block --latest --shard-id 1
```

To call an existing smart contract:

```bash
nil_cli contract send CONTRACT_ADDRESS METHOD_NAME --abi METHOD_NAME
```

To read information about the resulting message:

```bash
nil_cli message --hash MESSAGE_HASH
```

To read the message receipt:

```bash
nil_cli receipt --hash MESSAGE_HASH
```

## Via the client library

The `Nil.js` client library 

To retrieve the block with the given hash:

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { PublicClient } from '@nilfoundation/niljs';

const client = new PublicClient({
    transport: new HttpTransport({
        endpoint: "{NIL_ENDPOINT}",
    }),
    shardId: 1,
});
const block = await client.getBlockByHash(BLOCK_HASH);
```

To call an existing smart contract after [**initializing a wallet**](./creating-a-wallet#via-the-client-library):

```typescript showLineNumbers
import {
  encodeFunctionData,
  type Abi,
} from "viem";

const data = encodeFunctionData({
    abi: CONTRACT_ABI as Abi,
    functionName: "{funcName}",
    args: [],
    }
);

const messageHash = await wallet.sendMessage({
    to: '{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}',
    data: data,
    value: 1000000n,
    gas: 100000n
});
    
```

To read information about the resulting message:

```typescript
const message = await client.getMessageByHash(messageHash);
```

To read the message receipt:


```typescript
const receipt = await client.getMessageReceiptByHash(messageHash);
```
