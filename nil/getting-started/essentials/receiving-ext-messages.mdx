# Receiving external messages

This tutorial explains how exactly a contract can accept external messages.

## `verifyExternal()`

The contract receiving [**an external message**](../../core-concepts/shards-parallel-execution##internal-vs-external-messages) must implement an additional function so that this call is processed. Unless this function is present, a contract cannot accept external messages. The function signature:

```solidity showLineNumbers
function verifyExternal(
        uint256 messageHash, 
        bytes calldata authData 
    ) external view returns (bool)
```

The purpose of the function is to limit who can call the receiver contract via an external message. Its body can hold any logic for checking the message signature.

As the receiving contract is charged with paying for external messages, the `verifyExternal()` function is needed so that external parties do not accidentally (or maliciously) drain the balance of the receiving contract.

:::info

`verifyExternal()` is executed every time a contract is called via an external message.

## Example

This example contains a simple mechanism for verifying `authData`:

```solidity showLineNumbers
contract Receiver {
    bytes32 private validAuthDataKeccak = AUTH_DATA_KECCAK;

    function verifyExternal(uint256 messageHash, bytes authData) external view returns (bool) {
        if (keccak256(authData) == AUTH_DATA_KECCAK) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
