# Handling async execution

To support [**cross-shard communication**](../../principles#cross-shard-communication), =nil; supports smart contracts making async calls to one another directly in Solidity code. 

This tutorial provides a brief theoretical and practical primer on async execution, and gives suggestions on how this feature can be integrated into an application.

## Performing an async call

Consider a smart contract with the following code:

```sol showLineNumbers
import "./nil.sol";

contract Caller {

    using Nil for address; 

    event CallCompleted(address indexed dst)

    function call(address dst) public payable {
        dst.asyncCall(address(0), gasleft(), false, msg.value, abi.encodeWithSignature("funcName"));
        emit CallCompleted(dst);
    }
}
```

The `address.asyncCall()` function makes it possible for the contract to call a function in another smart contract regardless of the shard where this contract is located. There are no additional actions required for making async calls: simply adding `address.asyncCall()` and specifying its arguments is sufficient.

:::info

The `address.asyncCall()` function is a shortcut for executing a precompiled contract responsible for managing async calls across the cluster.

:::info[Async calls on the same shard]

`address.asyncCall()` works even if the contract with the specified address is located on the same shard. The mechanism remains exactly the same as with cross-shard communications: the function will produce a new message, and the requested function in another contract will be executed whenever said message is processed by the shard.

## Examples

Consider two contracts deployed on two different shards in =nil;:

* Contract 1 (caller) is deployed on Shard 1
* Contract 2 (receiver) is deployed on Shard 2

There are two possible patterns for cross-shard communication between Contract 1 and Contract 2.

### Calling a contract on another shard

In this pattern, Contract 1 simply calls a function in Contract 2 without receiving a result. 

Contract 1 has the following structure:

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "./Nil.sol";

contract Caller {

    using Nil for address; 

    function call(address dst) public payable {
        dst.asyncCall(address(0), gasleft(), false, msg.value, abi.encodeWithSignature("increment()"));
    }

}
```

Contract 2 has the following structure:

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "./Nil.sol";

contract Receiver {

    uint256 private value;

    function increment() public {
        value += 1;
    }

    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }

}
```

Whenever the `call()` function is called inside Contract 1, a new outgoing message is spawned. When Shard 2 picks up this message and processes it, Contract 2 calls its `increment()` function. After `getValue()` is called, the result should display the total number of times the `call()` function was executed by Contract 1.

### Callback pattern

In this pattern, Contract 1 calls a function inside Contract 2 that makes an async call back to Contract 1.

Contract 1 acts as a simple escrow mechanism:

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "./Nil.sol";

contract Escrow {

    using Nil for address; 
    mapping (address => uint256) private deposits;

    function deposit() public payable {
        deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function submitForVerification(address dst, address participantOne, address participantTwo) public {
        dst.asyncCall(address(0), gasleft(), false, msg.value, abi.encodeWithSignature("verify(address, address)", participantOne, participantTwo));
    }

    function resolve(address participantOne, address participantTwo) public {
        deposits[participantOne] -= msg.value;
        deposits[participantTwo] += msg.value;
    }

    function verifyExternal(uint256 messageHash, bytes calldata authData) external view returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

Contract 2 acts as a validator for escrow resolution:

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "./Nil.sol";

contract Validator {
    
    using nil for address;

    function verify(address dst, address participantOne, address participantTwo) public {
        if (participantOne != participantTwo) {
            dst.asyncCall(address(0), gasleft(), false, msg.value, abi.encodeWithSignature("resolve(address, address)", participantOne, participantTwo));
        }
    }
}
```

Contract 2 triggers the `resolve()` function within Contract 1 as a callback but only if the escrow participants are two distinct addresses.
