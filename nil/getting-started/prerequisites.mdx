# Prerequisites

This page details the steps that need to be completed before working with =nil;.

## Installation

=nil; distributed as a standalone binary. Execute the following command to install it:

```bash
```

To run =nil;:

```bash
```

This will run the cluster locally.

## Solidity library

=nil; provides the `nil.sol` Solidity library that contains several 'helper' functions and function modifiers for working with the cluster.

To access the library, simply import it at the top of any smart contract:

```solidity
import "path/to/nil.sol";
```

With the library imported, use the `async_call()` function in the smart contract code to send a message to another contract deployed either on the same shard or on a different shard. The message will be processed asynchronously: it will spawn a special transaction, and whatever function was called via the message will be executed when this transaction is processed.

To read more about what is included in the Solidity library, [**click here**](../tools/sol-library/func-modifiers).

[**Click here**](../core-concepts/shards-parallel-execution#async-execution) to learn more about the theory behind async execution, or [**click here**](./essentials/handling-async-execution) to see practical examples of using `async_call()` for cross-shard communications.

## =nil; CLI

The =nil; CLI is an easy-to-use tool for interacting with the cluster from any shell: it supports all major operations and can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

The CLI is distributed as a standalone binary. To install it:

```bash
```

Click here for a full list of commands that can be used via the =nil; CLI.

## Client library

The =nil; client library is a JavaScript module that allows for interating with the cluster using JS classes and functions.

The library can be installed similarly to any other module.


<Tabs groupId='packageSystem'>
  <TabItem value='npm' label='npm'>
    ```bash
    npm install @nilfoundation/niljs
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='yarn' label='yarn'>
    ```bash
    yarn add @nilfoundation/niljs
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Afterward, import the necessary functions and classes from the library:

```js
import { ... } from "@nilfoundation/niljs";
```
