# Overview

## Definition

=nil; is a sharded blockchain that leverages the following features:

* **Modularity**. =nil; offers an execution layer while using Ethereum for data availability and consensus.
* **Horizontal scalability**. In =nil;, execution is spread across shards, allowing for completing tasks in parallel.
* **Vertical scalability**. Validator implementation in =nil; is scaled vertically via intra-shard parallelization.

=nil; offers an effective strategy for scaling Ethereum while avoiding the limitations typically associated with the modular approach such as state and liquidity fragmentation.

:::tip[Why =nil;?]

As =nil; is highly scalable, it is ideal for applications that are demanding in terms of algorithm complexity, or time and memory usage:

* Crowdsourcing platforms
* Autonomous virtual worlds
* Decentralized exchanges
