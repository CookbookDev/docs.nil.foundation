# Overview

## Definition

=nil; is a sharded blockchain that leverages the following features:

* **Modularity**. =nil; acts as an execution layer while using Ethereum for data availability and consensus.
* **Horizontal scalability**. In =nil;, state is spread across shards with cross-shard communications being a built-in feature of the protocol.
* **Vertical scalability**. Validator implementation in =nil; is scaled vertically via intra-shard parallelization.

=nil; transcends the typical monolithic vs. modular discourse by relying on zkSharding, a new type of sharding architecture. In zkSharding, execution shards produce zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) verifying intra-shard state transitions while the state of the cluster is managed by a designated consensus shard. The consensus shard is responsible for producing a 'master' ZKP that is sent to Ethereum for global state verification.

=nil; offers an effective strategy for scaling Ethereum while avoiding the limitations typically associated with the modular approach such as state and liquidity fragmentation.

:::tip[Why =nil;?]

As =nil; is highly scalable, it is ideal for applications that are demanding in terms of algorithm complexity, or time and memory usage:

* Crowdsourcing platforms
* Autonomous virtual worlds
* Decentralized exchanges

:::

:::info[Throughput]

The scaling solution introduced by =nil; offers a throughput of up to 60,000 transactions per second.
