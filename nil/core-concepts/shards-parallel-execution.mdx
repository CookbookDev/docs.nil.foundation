# Shards and parallelized execution

## Definition

Shards are smaller chains that are usually responsible for managing a portion of the global state of the 'main' chain. In =nil;, there exist two types of shards.

* Execution shards process transactions of the accounts allocated to these shards
* The consensus shard coordinates execution shards and submits ZKPs of the global state to Ethereum

## Execution shards

An execution shard has the allocated accounts, executes transactions related to these accounts, and generates ZKPs verifying state transitions.

:::info[Mempools]

Although each shard has its own mempool of transactions, there are no restrictions for the participants on what shard they can cooperate with.
