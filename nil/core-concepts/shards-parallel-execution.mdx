# Shards and parallelized execution

## Definition

Shards are smaller chains that are usually responsible for managing a portion of the global state of the main chain. In =nil;, there exist two types of shards.

* Execution shards process transactions of the accounts allocated to these shards
* The consensus shard coordinates execution shards and submits ZKPs of the global state to Ethereum

## Execution shards

All work related to processing transactions, managing cross-shard communications, storing accounts, and managing the local state occurs at the execution shard level. Execution shards are also tasked with passing message passing checks.

:::info[Mempools]

Although each shard has its own mempool of transactions, there are no restrictions for the participants on what shard they can cooperate with.

:::

### Message passing checks

To support [**cross-shard communications**](../principles#cross-shard-communication), execution shards must record all necessary outgoing messages posted in other execution shards.

Each message contains information about its destination account. If a shard sees that a message targets one of the accounts in the shard, the shard must include this message in its next block. Such outgoing messages are called necessary messages and new blocks are considered invalid unless they include all necessary messages.

:::info

As the number of execution shards grows, this process may be changed so that shards are only tasked with tracking messages from their neighbors. The closeness of shards can be determined by their Hamming distance.

### Async execution

Generally, the term 'async execution' describes delegating the completion of a task to a dedicated CPU thread or a similar isolated component. While this task is processed, the main program can freely execute other instructions, and then react to receiving the results of the async task.

In =nil;, async execution refers to calling a contract that is deployed on another shard. The time taken to execute this call may vary, and the 'caller' contract is also free to execute other instructions without having to wait for the results of the call.

Consider two contracts deployed on two different shards in =nil;:

* Contract 1 (caller) is deployed on Shard 1
* Contract 2 (receiver) is deployed on Shard 2

The below diagram displays how an async call could work between Contract 1 and Contract 2.

      'primaryTextColor': '#f1f1f1',
      'primaryBorderColor': '#434343',
      'lineColor': '#F8B229',
      'secondaryColor': '#181A1B',
      'tertiaryColor': '#fff'
    }
  }
}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant S1 as Shard 1 with Contract 1
    participant S2 as Shard 2 with Contract 2
    S1 ->> S1: Contract 1 calls a function<br>inside Contract 2
    S1 ->> S1: Shard 1 creates a new transaction<br>whose destination is Shard 2
    Note right of S1: Contract 1 is freed and can execute other operations
    S1 --> S2: Shard 2 picks up the transaction<br>and adds it to the mempool
    S2 ->> S2: Shard 2 executes the transaction<br>and includes it in a block
    S2 ->> S2: Contract 2 executes the function<br>that Contract 1 called   
```

The key stages of this flow are:

1. Contract 1 calls a function inside Contract 2, which creates a new transaction
2. Shard 2 must pick up this transaction and place it inside its mempool
3. When Shard 2 processes the transaction, Contract 2 executes the function that Contract 1 called

:::info

Transactions that originate as a result of cross-shard calls are known as [**cross-shard transactions**](../guides/architecture/ethereum-nil-diffs#transactions). They constitute a separate transaction type in addition to Ethereum-style transactions supported by =nil;.

:::info[Callback pattern]

There is also a variation of the above flow in which the function inside Contract 2 makes an async call back to Contract 1.

In this case, the flow would work as follows:

1. Contract 1 calls a function inside Contract 2, creating a new transaction
2. Shard 2 executes the transaction, and Contract 2 calls the requested function
3. As part of executing the function, Contract 2 makes an async call back to Contract 1
4. Shard 1 picks up the new transaction from Shard 2 and executes it
5. Contract 1 performs whatever operation was requested by Contract 2

As shown above, the async call inside Contract 2 effectively becomes a callback function for Contract 1. Note that the use of this pattern is only possible if Contract 1 or Contract 2 share the same owner (or their owners cooperate with each other).

:::

### Internal vs. external messages 

In =nil;, messages are divided into internal and external.

Internal messages cover all types of communication between smart contracts on the network regardless of the shard where they are deployed. When Contract 1 (deployed on Shard 1) calls a function in Contract 2 (deployed on Shard 2), Shard 2 spawns an internal message.


External messages can originate only in one case: when any entity that exists outside of the cluster (e.g., a dApp) sends a message to any smart contract on the network.

:::info[Payment for messages]

For internal messages, the message itself is the 'payer' entity. An internal message spends its `value` to cover processing costs.

For external messages, the receiving contract is the 'payer' entity. To process external messages, the receiving contract must implement a special function that uses arbitrary logic to verify these messages. If this function is absent, the contract will only accept internal messages.

Regardless of the message type, the 'payer' is tasked with purchasing gas equal to the message `gasLimit`. The transaction fails if the balance of the 'payer' is insufficient. If execution is successful, the remaining gas is refunded to the 'payer'.

:::

## Consensus shard

In contrast to execution shards, [**the consensus shard**](../principles#consensus-shard) is responsible for the following functions:

* Managing global consensus
* Producing 'master' ZKPs for verifying global state changes
* Setting the protocol rules and parameters

:::note[Security guarantees]

Although =nil; relies on ZKPs to verify state transitions statelessly, ZKPs can be costly to generate. As a result, a standard security protocol is used to provide security guarantees while ZKPs are generated.

The committee of an execution shard runs a [**Multi-Threshold BFT security protocol**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484554) which is a varioation of Sync HotStuff. This is done so that the safety threshold at the local level is not tied to the safety threshold of the cluster.

After running the local consensus protocol, leaders of all committees transmit block digests and quorum certificates to the leader of the consensus shard. The consensus shard leader then proposes a new block to the consensus shard committee, which includes the entire set of validators. These validators run a HotStuff-2 consensus protocol to achieve global consensus.
