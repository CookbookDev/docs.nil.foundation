# Shards and parallelized execution

## Definition

Shards are smaller chains that are usually responsible for managing a portion of the global state of the main chain. In =nil;, there exist two types of shards.

* Execution shards process transactions of the accounts allocated to these shards
* The consensus shard coordinates execution shards and submits ZKPs of the global state to Ethereum

## Execution shards

All work related to processing transactions, storing accounts, and managing the local state occurs at the execution shard level. Execution shards are also tasked with passing message passing checks.

:::info[Mempools]

Although each shard has its own mempool of transactions, there are no restrictions for the participants on what shard they can cooperate with.

### Message passing checks

To support [**cross-shard communications**](../principles#cross-shard-communication), execution shards must record all necessary outgoing messages posted in other execution shards.

Each message contains information about its destination account. If a shard sees that a message targets one of the accounts in the shard, the shard must include this message in its next block. Such outgoing messages are called necessary messages and new blocks are considered invalid unless they include all necessary messages.

:::info

As the number of execution shards grows, this process may be changed so that shards are only tasked with tracking messages from their neighbors. The closeness of shards can be determined by their Hamming distance.

## Consensus shard

In contrast to execution shards, [**the consensus shard**](../principles#consensus-shard) is responsible for the following functions:

* Managing global consensus
* Producing 'master' ZKPs for verifying global state changes
* Setting the protocol rules and parameters

:::note[Security guarantees]

Although =nil; relies on ZKPs to verify state transitions statelessly, ZKPs can be costly to generate. As a result, a standard security protocol is used to provide security guarantees while ZKPs are generated.

The committee of an execution shard runs a [**Multi-Threshold BFT security protocol**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484554) which is a varioation of Sync HotStuff. This is done so that the safety threshold at the local level is not tied to the safety threshold of the cluster.

After running the local consensus protocol, leaders of all committees transmit block digests and quorum certificates to the leader of the consensus shard. The consensus shard leader then proposes a new block to the consensus shard committee, which includes the entire set of validators. These validators run a HotStuff-2 consensus protocol to achieve global consensus.
