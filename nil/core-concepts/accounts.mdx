# Accounts

## Definition

In =nil;, an account is the minimal unit of data for sharding. An account consists of an address, its balance, its storage root and the hash of its source code.

Each execution shard handles only a dedicated part of all accounts in the global state of the cluster.

Accounts are distributed among shards using the following deterministic function.

$$
F_s : (pk, M_{shards})\to id_{shard}
$$

, where $pk$ is the public key of an account and $M_{shards}$ is the history and metadata of each execution shard.

## Security and rollbacks

In the case of a malicious node initiating an attack, the validator committee for the affected shard must initiate a rollback of all affected accounts.

This means that the corrupted accounts must be 'reset' to their last verified state.
