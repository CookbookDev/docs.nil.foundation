# Contract co-location

## Definition

[**Cross-shard communications**](./shards-parallel-execution#message-passing-checks) are a built-in feature of the =nil; protocol.

However, participants can also incur ownership and economic restrictions to ensure that two accounts are consistently located within the same shard (co-location). If two accounts are co-located, transactions involving these accounts are processed faster compared to transactions requiring cross-shard communications.

:::info[Splitting and merging]

Co-location persists during [**shard splitting and merging**](./shards-parallel-execution#splitmerge-conditions-checks). This means it is a reliable way of avoiding the typical overheads associated with cross-shard communication.

## Scalability considerations

On the one hand, contract co-location presents a valuable opportunity for developers wanting to ensure the lowest possible transaction processing times for their users.

On the other hand, co-location encourages having as many accounts as possible on one shard, undermining horizontal scaling.

To mitigate this, =nil; imposes economic and ownership restrictions on account co-location. These restrictions are expressed in terms of co-location depth, which is the number of addresses ($N$) a given address is co-located with. 

:::note[Formula]

The co-location formula of an address $A$ is as follows:

$$
\vert S_A \vert = \vert \bigcup S \vert S \bigcap A \vert
$$

:::

### Economic restrictions

The cost of each co-location depends on the resulting co-location depth of an address.

When an address is initialized, its basic initial creation cost includes the following:

* The basic transaction fee
* The address activation cost
* The bytecode size of the application
* The constructor call cost
* The cost of data reserved by the application
* The cost of setting initial values

The basic address creation cost $b$ is multiplied by the co-location multiplier $k$ as shown in the following formula:

$$
address \space creation \space fee = b * k^{\vert M_A \vert}
$$

The higher the co-location depth, the higher the co-location multiplier and the total costs of creating a new account.

### Ownership restrictions

Only addresses controlled by the same key can be co-located.

:::tip[Justification]

Ownership restrictions prevent malicious users from attacking popular applications. Without them, such users would have been able to co-locate their addresses with other popular addresses, significantly increasing the costs of co-location in a given shard.

:::

To enforce ownership restrictions, the consensus shard runs a special application known as the co-location manager. The co-location manager stores an explicit map, where sets of co-located addresses are bound to the accounts (domains) that initialized them.

Coupled with economic restrictions, the costs of co-location are equal to:

$$
address \space creation \space fee = b * k^{\vert M_A \vert} + e
$$

, where $e$ are the costs of calling the co-location manager.

:::tip[Structure]

```bash
class CoLocationManager {
    // Data structure to store co-location domains
    domains: map[address -> array[address]];

    // Attempts to co-locate two addresses
    co-locate: function(pair<address, address>) -> bool {
        // Checks and updates 'domains' to include the new co-location if possible
        // Returns true if co-location is successful, false otherwise
    };

    // Releases the co-location relationship between two addresses
    release: function(pair<address, address>) -> bool {
    // Updates 'domains' to remove the specified co-location
    // Returns true if the operation is successful, false otherwise
    };

    // Checks if two addresses are co-located
    is_co_located: function(pair<address, address>) -> bool {
    // Returns true if the addresses are in the same co-location group, false otherwise
    };

    // Calculates the fee for address creation or co-location based on co-location depth
    calculate_fee: function(address) -> number {
    // Calculates and returns the fee based on the co-location depth of the address
    };

    // Retrieves the co-location group for a given address
    get_co_location_group: function(address) -> array[address] {
    // Returns the array of addresses that are co-located with the address
    };
}
```

:::

Validators assigned to a shard must track the co-location manager and process the transactions made by accounts on the same shard.

:::info[Sync execution]

As co-location ensures that accounts always stay on the same shard, it allows for sync execution of account code. This means that Ethereum applications can be re-deployed and run on =nil; without the need to modify their code to handle async operations.
