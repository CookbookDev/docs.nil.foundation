# Contract co-location

## Definition

[**Cross-shard communications**](./shards-parallel-execution#message-passing-checks) are a built-in feature of the =nil; protocol ensuring horizontal scalability with no fragmentation.

However, =nil; also supports contract co-location, which is a technique for ensuring that two accounts are located on the same shard. In this case, interaction between these accounts does not require cross-shard communications.

In plain terms, co-location is a request made to change the value stored under the account's address in [**the mapping of accounts and shards**](./accounts) stored in the consensus shard. 

:::note[Explanation]

When two accounts (Account 1 and Account 2) are co-located, communications between them can occur synchronously similarly to regular Ethereum transactions. 

However, this is not the case if Account 1 and Account 2 are placed in different shards and Account 1 calls a function in Account 2. In this situation, the transaction from Account 1 must create another transaction that subsequently performs an async call to the function in Account 2. This async transaction could then be executed in a future block in the shard where Account 2 is located.

This ensures that sharding does not result in fragmentation.

## Scalability considerations

On the one hand, contract co-location presents a valuable opportunity for developers wanting to ensure the lowest possible transaction processing times for their users.

On the other hand, co-location encourages having as many accounts as possible on one shard, undermining the benefits of horizontal scaling.

This concern, however, is mitigated by basic market mechanics: 

* The more accounts exist on the same shard (and the more transactions are submitted by them), the higher the gas price 
* The higher the gas price, the higher the cost of each transaction
* The higher the cost of each transaction, the lower the benefits-to-costs ratio of co-locating additional accounts

It is up to the market participants to determine whether co-location is worth incurring high transaction costs.
