# Transaction lifecycle

## Definition

In =nil;, a transaction carrying an external message passes the following stages before reaching finality.

1. A transaction is submitted by a user
2. The message goes to the mempool of an execution shard
3. The message is picked up by a collator that bundles it with other message and sends the resulting batch for execution
4. The message is executed and is sent into a block
5. The block passes local consensus while the shard generates a ZKP
6. The block with the message is sent into storage and the message reaches soft finality
7. The ZKP and the block are sent to the consensus shard that produces a 'master' ZKP

Additional remarks about each of the above stages are given below.

## Stages

### Transaction submission and processing

A user submits a transaction autonomously. This transaction reaches its destination, and the message it carries is added to the mempool of the target execution shard.

In some cases, the external message may also cause the receiving contract to send additional internal messages to other smart contracts some of which may be located on other shards. As part of the =nil; protocol, execution shards poll other execution shards about outgoing messages. After a new message is submitted, its destination shard retrieves it from its shard of origin and places it in its mempool for subsequent execution.

### Passing the collator

The collator then retrieves the transaction from the mempool and bundles it together with other transaction. The resulting bundle is executed, and the transaction is included in the new block produced by the execution shard.

At the end of this stage, the block with the transaction is sent for verification via local consensus. [**Click here**](./shards-parallel-execution#consensus-shard) to learn more about local consensus.

### Achieving soft finality

After the block containing the transaction is built, execution shards produce a ZKP and send it to the consensus shard along with block hashes. In the meantime, the block with the transaction reaches storage, and the transaction achieves soft finality.

:::info

When =nil; supports communications with L1, a special application running on top of the consensus shard will submit [**data availability transactions**](../specification/data-availability) to Ethereum. 

In this case, transactions will reach soft finality when the corresponding data availability transactions are verified in Ethereum slots.

:::note[ZKPs]

ZKPs allow for trustless verification of state transitions inside execution shards and the consensus shard. ZKP generation is handled by dedicated participants (proof producers). To learn more about this process, [**click here**](../specification/finality).

### Achieving hard finality

The consensus shard also verifies the proof from the shard with the transaction and creates a 'master' ZKP. 

When this feature is supported, the 'master' ZKP will be sent to the =nil; smart contract on Ethereum where it will be verified. At this stage, the transaction will achieve absolute finality.
