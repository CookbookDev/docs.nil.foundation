# Thesis

This page explains the rationale behind the architecture of =nil; and provides insight into how =nil; resolves the fundamental monolithic vs. modular dispute.

## Problem statement

The rollup-centric roadmap to scaling Ethereum and the rise in the popularity of rollups introduced a significant issue: state fragmentation.

State fragmentation means that parts of Ethereum's global state are effectively scattered across systems that are distinct from Ethereum itself. This leads to the following outcomes:

* Liquidity and users are spread across various networks all of which have a unique infrastructure
* Cross-network operations being difficult to secure, producing more hacks
* Worsened developer and user experience. It falls either on developers or users to ensure cross-chain operations which adds an unnecessary layer of complexity

The architecture of =nil; is designed specifically to resolve these issues.

## Solution
