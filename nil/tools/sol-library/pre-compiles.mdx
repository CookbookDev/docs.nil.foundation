# Pre-compiles and Solidity functions

=nil; provides several pre-compiled contracts that abstract over complex operations and provide a quick way to execute computationally-heavy actions.

## `ASYNC_CALL`

`ASYNC_CALL` is a pre-compile for the `async_call()` function that allows for async execution of contract functions:

```solidity showLineNumbers
function async_call(
        address dst,
        address refundTo,
        uint gas,
        bool deploy,
        uint value,
        bytes memory call_data
    ) internal
```

The contract takes a function call and spawns a new transaction. Whenever this transaction is included in a block of its destination shard, the function call is executed.

[**Click here**](../../core-concepts/shards-parallel-execution##async-execution) for a primer on async execution and [**here**](../../getting-started/essentials/handling-async-execution) for a tutorial on using `async_call()`.

## `VERIFY_SIGNATURE`

`VERIFY_SIGNATURE` is a pre-compile for the `validateSignature()` function. The function has the following signature:

```solidity showLineNumbers
function validateSignature(
        bytes memory pubkey,
        uint256 hash,
        bytes memory signature
    ) internal view returns (bool)
```

The function verifies if the given message signature is valid for the provided `pubKey` and `hash`.

## `SEND_MESSAGE`

`SEND_MESSAGE` is a pre-compile for the `send_msg()` function:

```solidity showLineNumbers
function send_msg(uint g, bytes memory message) internal
```

The function sends a 'raw' message to the pre-compile without performing any encoding or other modification on the message.

## `IS_INTERNAL_MESSAGE`

`IS_INTERNAL_MESSAGE` is a pre-compile for the `isInternalMessage()` function:

```solidity showLineNumbers
function isInternalMessage() internal view returns (bool)
```

The function is called as part of [**the `onlyInternal` and `onlyExternal` function modifiers**](./func-modifiers) to check if a given message is internal.
