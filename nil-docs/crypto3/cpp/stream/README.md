# Stream

The Crypto3.Stream library extends the =nil;Foundation's cryptography suite. It provides a set of stream ciphers implemented in the way the C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behaviour, latest standard features support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.

Crypto3.Stream consists of several parts to review:

- Manual
- Implementation
- Concepts

A small part of each topic is reviewed right at the introduction, but detailed information is recommended to look inside a corresponding chapter.

## Algorithms

Crypto3.Stream library contains the following block ciphers:

- Chacha
- Salsa20
- RC4

## Dependencies
