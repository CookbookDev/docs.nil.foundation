# Documentation Repository for =nil;

This repository is the host of the Docusaurus project that handles documentation for =nil; Foundation. 

# Structure

The project follows the monorepo pattern to simplify dependency management.

There exist four separate sets of docs in the following folders.

* `./zkllvm`
* `./proof-market`
* `./zksharding`
* `./crypto3`

Each set of docs is connected to a single React app which is configured in the `docusaurus.config.js` file.
