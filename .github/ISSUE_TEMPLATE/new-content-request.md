**How should new content fit into documentation?**
It can be placed in an existing section or form an entirely new section.

**What topic should be covered by new content and what format should it take?**
Provide a short description such as '*It would be nice to see a tutorial for constructing a zkRollup*' or '*Please add a new code example of EsDSA signature verification in Rust*'

**Why exactly should new content be added?**
Justify adding new content, see the following examples for reference.
* '*It is unclear how exactly `assigner` can be extended to support AIR arithmetization, a tutorial series is needed*'
* '*The community needs to learn more about how the main shard communicates with execution shards in our L2, please add an explanation*'
* '*I want to use a special build system to build the compiler but the documentation does not contain any instructions for this system. The system is fairly popular so the community will appreciate it if you add this info*'
